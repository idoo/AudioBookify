## 1. Introduction

## 2. Information Collection

### Local Processing
- **Files and Metadata:**  
  Any files or metadata you import into the App (e.g., MP3 files, text files, EPUB books, cover images, and their associated metadata) are processed locally on your device. No file content is sent to any external server.

- **Text-to-Speech Processing:**  
  All text-to-speech synthesis is performed locally on your Mac using on-device AI models. Your text content is never transmitted to external servers.

### Subscription and Purchase Data
- **Apple In-App Purchases:**  
  When you subscribe to Audiobook Maker Pro, your purchase is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information (credit card numbers, billing address, etc.). Apple handles all payment processing in accordance with their [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

- **Subscription Status:**  
  We receive confirmation of your subscription status (active/expired) from Apple to provide you with access to premium features. This does not include any personal financial information.

### Usage Tracking (Local Only)
- **Usage Limits:**  
  To enforce the free tier limit (3 audiobooks per month), we store a count of audiobooks created locally on your device using secure Keychain storage. This data:
  - Remains entirely on your device
  - Is not transmitted to any server
  - Does not include any content of your audiobooks
  - Is used solely to determine your remaining free usage

- **Device Identifier:**  
  A hardware-based identifier is generated and stored locally to maintain your usage count across app reinstalls. This identifier:
  - Never leaves your device
  - Cannot be used to identify you personally
  - Is not shared with any third party

### No Analytics or Telemetry
We do not track, monitor, or collect any behavioral data. The App does not include any third-party trackers, analytics SDKs, or telemetry.

## 3. How Information Is Used

| Data Type | Purpose | Stored Where | Shared With |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Files & content | Audiobook creation | Your device only | No one |
| Usage count | Free tier enforcement | Device Keychain | No one |
| Subscription status | Feature access | Device & Apple | Apple only |

All operations occur locally on your device to enable the functionality of the App.

## 4. Data Security

- **Local Data Security:**  
  Usage data is stored in the macOS Keychain, which provides hardware-level encryption. We encourage you to secure your device with appropriate measures such as using strong passwords and keeping your operating system updated.

- **No Transmission of Personal Data:**  
  Because no personal data is transmitted over the Internet, the risk of external data breaches is minimized.

- **Apple's Security:**  
  Subscription transactions are protected by Apple's security infrastructure.
